        <p>The First Week: From Entering the new Flat, to the adventures around London</p>
        
      
        <h1>Day 1: Travel and entering the flat (10/05/2021)</h1>
        <p>What a day! Woke up at 5:30am or thereabouts. I was actually awake before that, but as usual, I don't make much noise and just chat to friends on my phone silently. Anyway, 5.30am my parents wake up. All of a sudden it struck me that I would be going away and they wouldn't be there anymore. I started to cry uncontrollably in my room as my mother tries to console me and tells me that she can visit me whenever I want. I guess that helps. Anyway, I soon recover from that panic moment and we get the liggage into the car and head off to Dublin Airport. Flight is at 9:00am sharp and I am just so tired. Airport security is a mess and I get stopped twice: once probably because my DJI Osmo 3 Gimball looks kinda like a gun on the XRay machines, the other for a "random spot check". Moral of the story, I end up having to take everything out of my backpack and I start feeling a bit upset because my mam had taken such great care to pack everything neatly and I can't put it back the way it was. Luckily, she had given me a second bag with some food to I end up having to put the extra jacket in there. Pfew!</p>        
        <p>Flight is pretty much OK. Everything is on time and I can't complain to RyanAir. Landing was a little rough, but not too bad.</p>
        <p>Once in Stansted, I reach the exit of the Airport without anyone asking me for my identity documents... {Eyes rolling} wI wounder how all the terrorists get in, yeah...! Once outside the airport, having picked up all my luggage from the luggage belts, I head to the Stansted Express Train with destination London Liverpool Street Station. ETA is 12.02pm, so about 50min journey. Let me just say that that journey was one to forget. Literally everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong (okay, not everything, but the things I wanted to go right went wrong). Let me start from the beginning. Before boarding the train, I put on my reading glasses as I am not able to read text clearly on the information panels in the station. Mark this fact here because it is really important. I set my luggage in the designated luggage space on Coach H. The train was very celan and on time, at least on departure. We pass some stations, and all appears fine. Unitl we reach shortly after Bishop's Stortford just before coming into Harlow Town. There is a strong smell of cigarette smoke in the WC near me, and the smoke detector goes off. Train is halted for a good 7-8min, and that's where the troubles begin. I reach the station on Liverpool Street late, I try to get a taxi using the FreeNow app, but shortly after booking it tells me that the taxi driver (Mitchell was his name) was there. I can't however understand where I am and I end up cancelling the ride, and sucking up the 5GBP fee for cancellation. I take another taxi (this time I don't try my luck with that app haha) and I go to the man, knock on the windoe and he lets me in. The taxis are so cool and weird at the same time in London. It's like the taxi company has their own make and model of cars. They look very retro and insanely cool in my opinion. Anyway, by the time I reach the house it is 12.27, and unfortunately the only housemate that was there had just left to go to her boyfriend's house for 1.5hr. I was already starting to panic, as she wouldn't answer my texts or calls.</p>
        <p>Anyway, luckily I had the phone number of the girl whose room I was "inheriting", Silvia, so I text her to ask her what I can do. She says she is terribly sorry of the situation and sends me the phone number of the agent. I ring them and within 12 minutes, the agent was there to open the door for me. I was shocked at how kind he was with me: he even offered to help me with the luggage as there was no lift in the block. I was literally in tears of joy there.</p>
        <p>Upon entering the room, I lay out my suitcases and begin to unload them into the small chest of drawers that is in my room, soon realising that there is no way they are really going to all fit in there. I don't even look at the tecnology I had brought.</p>
        <p>Once I have placed some clothes in the chest of drawers, I phone my parents to tell them that all has been solved and that I am in the room. They give me the checklist of things to buy in Sainsbury and I go there to buy a few things. I come back and as I'm entering the room, it strikes me that I forgot teh duvet and pillow, which were the two most important things on that list. So I begin to set up the things I already had bought and then go back for round 2 of shoopping. Luckily the supermarket is only a 4 minuites walk from the flat and so even though I'm wrecked, I still manage to go and come back ok. It is during my first visit to the supermarket that I realize I don't have my reading glasses. I begin to panick again and contact Greater Anglia (the train company) where I think I lost them. I tell my mam over video call and she says not to worry that they were anyway due a change as the frame was effectively 3 years old.</p>
        <p>I have a video call with my friend from Philippines and one with my mam who shows me exactly how to makje the bed. As you can probably tell, I am the stereotypical IT person who is totally incapable of looking after themselves.</p>
        <p>I am really tired after all of that and probably for the first time in years, I don't even open my laptop and go to bed instantly. </p>
        
        <h1>Day 2: More shoppping and a cool visit to the Thames River and Canary Wharf</h1>
        <p>Today, I slept until about 9am. I waited for DHL to come and collect Silvia's package and then headed to collect my Residence Permit from the Post Office in Houndsditch. Once I had that, I came back home (I will be referring to my room as home from now on). I spent a few hours tidying up everything in the room and setitng up my "office space"... See picture aat the end (Image 1). Afterwards, I decided to go exploring London and it's attractions. I set out with the goal of reaching the Thames River. Surprisingly, it proved difficult to reach the actual riverside walk, but I managed to find a spot with an amazing view so I used it to try out the new "Pano" mode on my DJI Osmo. Turns out it is phenomenal (see image 2). On the way back, I bought some utensils in Sainsbury's. I actually accidentally stole a 4GBP cutlery set... I had forgotten I ahd put it in my bag and forgot to scan it at the till hahaha! Oh well, I guess I earned it. 
        I bought all the ingredients for making a courgette omelette, so I'll try that out tomorrow. </p>
